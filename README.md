Employee Retention Analysis & Strategy
📌 Overview

This project focuses on analyzing employee retention patterns and identifying the key drivers of attrition. Using workforce data and HR analytics, the analysis provides actionable insights and proposes data-driven strategies to improve retention and reduce turnover costs.

🔑 Final Insights

Work–life Balance: Employees value flexible schedules; rigid models increase turnover risk.

Career Progression: Lack of clear promotion paths and development opportunities causes disengagement.

Recognition & Culture: Feeling undervalued drives attrition, even when compensation is competitive.

Compensation: Pay and benefits that lag behind market benchmarks push employees to seek alternatives.

Implications: If unaddressed, these challenges can raise recruitment costs, reduce productivity, and weaken employer brand competitiveness.
